    <p>UManSysProp is an online facility for calculating the properties of
    individual organic molecules and ensemble mixtures. Built using <a
    href="http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page">open source chemical
    informatics</a>, the facilities provided are divided according to broad
    applications. Click on each tab above for a description of that
    application.</p>

    <p>Rather than automatically choosing a technique for each calculation,
    users have the option to select from a wide range of peer reviewed methods.
    The relevant literature for each method is listed in the 'bibiliography'
    section of this site. Where appropriate users are provided with a brief
    summary on the applicability of individual techniques. Input is currently
    based on the <a
    href="http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smiles.html">SMILES</a>
    string convention and users have the option to use a text based entry
    system, select pre-defined compounds or perform batch simulations with a
    file upload system.</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        {% for tool_name, tool in tools.items()|sort %}
        <tr>
          <td>
            <a href="{{ url_for('tool', name=tool_name) }}">
              {{ tool_name }}
            </a>
          </td>
          <td>{{ tool.__doc__ }}</td>
        </tr>
        {% endfor %}
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>If you are not familiar with the SMILES convention, <a
      href="http://umansysprop.seaes.manchester.ac.uk/External_html/JChemDraw.html">click
    here to open up a new window</a> and use the canvas in the powered by the
    <a href="http://jchempaint.github.io/">JChemPaint java applet</a>. You will
    need to enable Java in your browser to use this facility whilst accepting
    the current security settings. There you can draw a molecular structure and
    generate a SMILES string using the <q>Tools</q> selection in the top
    menu.</p>
